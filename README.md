# PROJECT OBJECTIVE
Vrinda Store want to produce an annual sales report for 2022 in order to better understand its marketing strategy and increase sales in the upcoming year.

# Questions answered in the analysis
* Using a single chart, compare sales and orders, and identify the month with the highest sales and orders ?
* Men or women, who bought more in 2022 ?
* What are the various order statuses in 2022 ?
* What are the top five states in terms of total sales?
* Based on the amount of orders, depict the relationship between age and gender ?
* Which platform channel contributes the most to sales for vrinda store ?

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* First and foremost, I grasped the data in the data sets and identified business concerns.
* I prepared up the data by removing duplicates and null values from the dataset.
* I build an Age group column from the Age column using the nested =IF() technique, which helps to determine the purchases made by a specific age group.
* To overcome business difficulties, I created a Pivot table to summarize the data with charts and graphs.
* Finally, I created an Excel dashboard with slicers so that the people can interact with it and explore it in various ways to receive results.
